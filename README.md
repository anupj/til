# Today I Learned (TIL)

## About This Repository
This repository is a personal documentation of my daily learning journey in the world of programming and technology. Each entry in this repository represents something new that I learned about various languages, frameworks, or platforms.

The motivation behind this repository is not just to document my learnings but also to provide a resource for others who might find these tidbits of information useful.

### Structure

## Categories
